The aim of this project is to analyze my personal data with a focus on sleep patterns and physical activity metrics, such as steps and calorie burn, over a nearly one-year period (October 30, 2023, to October 14, 2024). The project incorporates academic contexts, including school semesters, exam weeks, and vacations, to explore how these factors influence sleep quality and physical health. The goal is to uncover trends, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights to optimize sleep and maintain a healthy lifestyle. The dataset combines wearable-tracked metrics (digital watches) with manually logged contextual factors. Sleep metrics include average awake time, total sleep duration, sleep quality, average REM, Core, and Deep sleep durations, and heart rate. Physical activity data, such as daily steps and calorie burn, is also included. Contextual labels, such as school semesters, exam weeks, and vacation periods, enrich the dataset. Occasionally tracked external factors, including screen time, are included to explore their influence on sleep and activity patterns.

Data for this project involves exporting information from the Apple Health app, which tracks sleep metrics, daily steps, and calorie burn. External contextual factors and academic periods will be manually integrated into the dataset to provide additional depth. Once the data is processed, exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted to analyze sleep metrics and physical activity trends across school semesters, exam weeks, and vacations, visualizing these trends using histograms, line charts, and heatmaps to identify patterns over time.

The project will include correlation analysis to examine relationships between sleep metrics (REM and Deep sleep), physical activity (steps and calorie burn), and external factors like screen time. Significant correlations will be visualized using scatter plots and heatmaps. Time-of-day and activity impacts will be assessed to understand the effects of daily steps and calorie burn on sleep quality and duration, with results visualized through histograms and density plots. Clustering techniques will be applied to group days into clusters based on sleep metrics, steps, and external factors, revealing patterns such as "High Stress, Low Sleep Quality" or "Vacation Recovery." Predictive modeling will be employed to build a model that predicts sleep quality using factors such as stress level, physical activity, and academic context, leveraging machine learning algorithms with hyperparameter tuning.

Contextual analysis will compare sleep and activity patterns during exam weeks, regular school periods, and vacations, testing hypotheses like "Sleep quality decreases significantly during exam weeks." The project will also simulate the impact of behavioral changes, such as increasing physical activity or reducing screen time, on sleep quality to provide personalized recommendations for improving sleep during critical periods like exam weeks. Deliverables will include trends in sleep quality and physical activity over time, correlation heatmaps to reveal influencing factors, cluster visualizations to identify distinct behavioral patterns, and predictive models to forecast sleep quality and provide actionable recommendations.

  The aim of this project is to analyze my personal data with focusing on analyzing sleep patterns and physical activity metrics, such as steps and calorie burn, over a nerly one-year period(Oct 30, 2023 to Oct 14,2024). The project incorporates academic contexts, including school semesters, exam weeks, and vacations, to explore how these factors influence sleep quality and physical health. The aim is to uncover trends, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights to optimize sleep and maintain a healthy lifestyle. The dataset combines wearable-tracked metrics(digital wathces) with manually logged contextual factors. Sleep metrics include average awake, sleep, quality, average REM, average Core and average Deep sleep durations, heart rate. Physical activity data, such as daily steps and calorie burn, is also included. Contextual labels, such as school semester, exam week, and vacation period, were added to enrich the dataset. Occasionally tracked external factors, including screen time, were included to explore their influence on sleep and activity patterns. 

  Data for this project involves exportation from the Apple Health app, which tracks sleep metrics, daily steps, and calorie burn. External contextual factors and academic periods will be manually integrated into the dataset to provide additional depth. Once the data was processed, with exploratory data analysis (EDA), will analyze sleep metrics and physical activity trends across school semesters, exam weeks, and vacations, visualizing these trends using histograms, line charts, and heatmaps to identify patterns over time.

  The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to analyze sleep metrics and physical activity trends across school semesters, exam weeks, and vacations, visualizing these trends using histograms, line charts, and heatmaps to identify patterns over time. Correlation analysis will be included to examine the relationships between sleep metrics (REM and deep sleep,...), physical activity (steps and calorie burn), and external factors like screen time identifying significant correlations through scatter plots and heatmaps. Time-of-day and activity impact will be looked to assess the effect of daily steps and calorie burn on sleep quality and duration, visualizing with histograms and density plots. Clustering also will be applied to group days into clusters based on stress, steps, and sleep metrics to identify patterns, such as "High Stress, Low Sleep Quality" or "Vacation Recovery," using clustering algorithms to reveal meaningful categories. Predictive modeling builds a model to predict sleep quality using factors such as stress level, physical activity, and academic context, employing machine learning algorithms with hyperparameter tuning. Contextual analysis compares sleep and activity patterns during exam weeks, regular school periods, and vacations, testing hypotheses like "Sleep quality decreases significantly during exam weeks." Optimization and recommendations simulate the impact of behavioral changes, such as increasing physical activity or reducing screen time, on sleep quality and provide personalized advice for improving sleep during some critical periods like exam weeks. The analysis includes trends in sleep quality and physical activity over time, correlation heatmaps to reveal the strongest influencing factors, cluster visualizations to identify distinct behavioral patterns, and predictive models to forecast sleep quality and provide actionable recommendations.
